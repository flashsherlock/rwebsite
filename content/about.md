# Me

I'm a graduate student, studying human olfaction with these nice [people](http://zhouw.psych.ac.cn/people.html) in [Institute of Psychology](http://www.psych.ac.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences. I received my BS in Psychology from [Beijing Normal University](http://psych.bnu.edu.cn/).

# The website

This website was build though [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package and hosted on [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com). The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/).
