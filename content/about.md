I'm a graduate student, studying human olfaction with these nice [people](http://zhouw.psych.ac.cn/people.html) in [Institute of Psychology](http://www.psych.ac.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences. I received my BS in Psychology from [Beijing Normal University](http://psych.bnu.edu.cn/). My favorite psychologist is B.F. Skinner. I was intrigued by his operant conditioning experiments when I read a textbook about animal behavior in high school. Currently, I am using fMRI and iEEG techniques to investigate neural representations of odor structure and valence, especially in the amygdala.

Except for exploring the brain, I also immerse myself in observing the night sky (I agree with Kant), as well as admiring the beauty of plants and animals. Photography, especially shooting flowers and insects, is my favorite hobby. You can find some of the photos on [my 500px homepage](https://500px.com.cn/flashsherlock).
