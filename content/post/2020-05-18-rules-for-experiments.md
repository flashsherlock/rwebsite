## Rules

In the chapter "Ten Simple Rules for Designing and Interpreting ERP Experiments" of the book *Event-Related Potentials: A Methods Handbook*, Steven J. Luck proposed ten rules for ERP experiments.

1. Peaks and components are not the same thing. There is nothing special about the point at which the voltage reaches a local maximum or minimum.

2. It is impossible to estimate the time course or peak latency of a latent ERP component by looking at a single ERP waveform – there may be no obvious relationship between the shape of a local part of the waveform and the underlying latent components.

3. It is extremely dangerous to compare an experimental effect (i.e., the difference between two ERP waveforms) with the raw ERP waveforms.

4. Differences in peak amplitude do not necessarily correspond to differences in component size, and differences in peak latency do not necessarily correspond to changes in component timing.

5. Never assume that an averaged ERP waveform accurately represents the single-trial waveforms.

6. Whenever possible, avoid physical stimulus confounds by using the same physical stimuli
across different psychological conditions. This includes “context” confounds, such as differences in
sequential order.

7. When physical stimulus confounds cannot be avoided, conduct control experiments to assess their plausibility. Never assume that a small physical stimulus difference cannot explain an ERP effect (even at a long latency).

8. Be cautious when comparing averaged ERPs that are based on different numbers of trials.

9. Be cautious when the presence or timing of motor responses differs between conditions.

10. Whenever possible, experimental conditions should be varied within trial blocks rather than between trial blocks.
