# Introduction
I found 3d visualization is really useful for understanding MRI results. Here is a brief guide which is mainly based on [this paper](https://f1000research.com/articles/4-466/v1).

# Convert nii to VTK
First of all, we should convert nii files to VTK format using [ITK-SNAP](https://www.itksnap.org/).

# Render in 3d
[Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) is an open source visualization application which could render VTK files as surface in 3d.
