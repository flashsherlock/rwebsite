# Inroduction
One of the key ideas behind ggplot2 is that it allows you to easily iterate, building up a complex plot a **layer** at a time, which is composed of five parts:

1. Data.
2. Aesthetic mappings.
3. A statistical transformation (stat).
4. A geometric object (geom).
5. A position adjustment.

# Build a plot layer by layer
