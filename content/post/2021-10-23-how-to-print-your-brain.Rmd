# My little brain

In this National Day holiday, I made a 3D model of my brain and found a company on Taobao to 3D-print it. The final product is 10cm × 9cm × 6.5cm in volume and about 200g weights. It looks so nice that every sulcus and gyrus was full of details. It is a really fantastic feeling to hold my brain in my hands.

Here, I will share what I did so that you can also print your own brain. The whole process is not very complicate, so take it easy.

# Print your brain step-by-step

## Scan your brain

First of all, you need to scan your brain with MRI, getting a T1 anatomical image. Participating in a MRI study is the best way to get this image.

## Reconstruct brain surfaces

Use [Freesurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FreeSurferWiki) command `recon-all` to reconstruct brain surfaces. Here is a template of this command. 

```bash
recon-all         \
  -sd subject_dir \ # root directory of the image
  -s subject_name \ # output directory
  -i input_image  \ # filename
  -all            \ # run all processing steps
  -parallel       \ # use more threads to improve speed
  -threads num_of_threads
```

## Convert and edit the surface

## Refine the brain model

I could not have printed my brain without the help of these perspicuous blog articles. You can also read these articles.
