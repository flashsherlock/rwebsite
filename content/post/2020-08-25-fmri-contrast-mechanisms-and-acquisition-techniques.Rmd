# Contrast Mechanisms and Acquisition Techniques
Two primary types of contrast are used in MRI. 

1. Static contrasts

Sensitive to the type, number, relaxation, and resonance properties of atomic nuclei within a voxel. Typical static contrasts are based on density (e.g., proton density), relaxation time (e.g., T1 , T2 , T2 *), chemical concentration (e.g., glutamate produced during cerebral metabolism), and even concentrations of particular types of molecules (e.g., macromolecules). We often use images sensitive to static contrast to determine brain anatomy in fMRI experiments. 

2. Motion contrasts

Sensitive to the movement of atomic nuclei. Typical motion contrasts provide information about the dynamic characteristics of the protons in the brain, such as blood oxygenation in fMRI, blood flow in MR angiography, water diffusion in diffusion-weighted imaging, and capillary irrigation in perfusion-weighted imaging.

## Static Contrasts

Static contrast mechanisms have been widely used in MRI thanks to their ability to illustrate basic tissue structural characteristics. There are two equations for magnetization after an initial excitation of a fully recovered spin system.
$$
\left \{ 
\begin{array}{l}
M_z(t)=M_0(1-e^{-\frac{t}{T_1}})\\
M_{xy}(t)=M_0e^{-\frac{t}{T_2}}
\end{array}
\right.
