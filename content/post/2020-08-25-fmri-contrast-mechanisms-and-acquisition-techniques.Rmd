# Contrast Mechanisms and Acquisition Techniques
Two primary types of contrast are used in MRI. 

1. Static contrasts

Sensitive to the type, number, relaxation, and resonance properties of atomic nuclei within a voxel. Typical static contrasts are based on density (e.g., proton density), relaxation time (e.g., T1 , T2 , T2 *), chemical concentration (e.g., glutamate produced during cerebral metabolism), and even concentrations of particular types of molecules (e.g., macromolecules). We often use images sensitive to static contrast to determine brain anatomy in fMRI experiments. 

2. Motion contrasts

Sensitive to the movement of atomic nuclei. Typical motion contrasts provide information about the dynamic characteristics of the protons in the brain, such as blood oxygenation in fMRI, blood flow in MR angiography, water diffusion in diffusion-weighted imaging, and capillary irrigation in perfusion-weighted imaging.

## Static Contrasts

Static contrast mechanisms have been widely used in MRI thanks to their ability to illustrate basic tissue structural characteristics. There are two equations for magnetization after an initial excitation of a fully recovered spin system.
$$
\left \{ 
\begin{array}{l}
M_z(t)=M_0(1-e^{-\frac{t}{T_1}})\\
M_{xy}(t)=M_0e^{-\frac{t}{T_2}}
\end{array}
\right.
$$
 
Under a short TR (The time interval between successive excitation pulses), which is not long enough to allow full recovery of the longitudinal magnetization ($M_0(1− e^{−TR/T1})$), the subsequent transverse magnetization is described as

$$M_{xy}(t) = M_0(1− e^{−\frac{TR}{T_1}})e^{−\frac{t}{T_2}}$$ 
<!-- rough values for the time constants T 1and T 2at a field strength of 1.5 T -->
<!-- |      | Gray Matter   | White Matter    | -->
<!-- |----- | ---------     | -------         | -->
<!-- |$T_1$ | 1400ms        | 1100ms          | -->
<!-- |$T_2$ | 70ms          | 55ms            | -->

The echo time (TE), which is the time interval between excitation and data acquisition (defined as the time when the signal from the center of k-space is acquired). For simplicity, we can replace the term t with TE to illustrate the MR signal for an image with a given TE:
$$M_{xy}(t) = M_0(1− e^{−\frac{TR}{T_1}})e^{−\frac{TE}{T_2}}$$
Moreover, in MRI, we are interested in comparing MR signals from multiple tissue types. To do so, we need to measure a difference in signal between any two types of tissue, known as contrast ($C_{AB}$).
$$C_{AB}= M_{0A}(1− e^{−\frac{TR_A}{T_1}})e^{−\frac{TE_A}{T_2}}− M_{0B}(1− e^{−\frac{TR_B}{T_1}})e^{−\frac{TE_B}{T_2}}$$

### Proton-density contrast

Proton-density images, as the name implies, provide contrast based on the sheer number of protons in a voxel, which, of course, differs in different tissue types. 

To maximize proton-density contrast, researchers use pulse sequences that minimize T1 and T2 contrasts. To minimize T1 contrast, a pulse sequence must use very long TR (e.g., three times as long as T1) to ensure full T1 recovery, and to minimize T2 contrast, a pulse sequence must use a very short TE (e.g., one-tenth as long as T2) to prevent any significant T2 decay.

One disadvantage of using a very long TR is that it greatly increases imaging time. To reduce acquisition time while still maintaining proton-density contrast, a smaller flip angle (less than 90°) may be used for excitation, to only partially tip the longitudinal magnetization toward the transverse plane.

To facilitate tissue segmentation, protondensity images are frequently acquired at the same slice locations as T1 - or T2 -weighted images (see below) so that complementary anatomical information can be acquired.

### T1 contrast
For any two tissues that differ in T1 , there is an optimal TR value that maximally differentiates between them. To have exclusive T1 contrast, we must also have a very short TE in order to minimize T 2contrast. Note that the proton density of the tissues always contributes to the contrast, because the number of spins in the imaging volume determines the original net magnetization.

Images of T 1contrast elicit the most signal from white matter and bone marrow, due to their short T1  values, and an intermediate amount of signal from gray matter.

To boost T1 contrast, researchers often use a technique called **inversion recovery**, which begins the sequence with a 180° inversion pulse rather than the more common 90° pulse. Because the inversion pulse flips the net magnetization to the negative state, it effectively doubles the dynamic range of the signal.

### T2 contrast
To have exclusive T2 contrast, we must have a very long TR so that the longitudinal recovery is almost complete and T1 contrast is minimal. At an intermediate TE, the difference in transverse magnetization can be maximized.

T2-weighted images can only be generated using spin-echo-based pulse sequences because only SE sequences allow true spin–spin relaxation that does not depend on the field inhomogeneity.

T2 values depend on spin–spin interactions; thus, homogeneous tissues tend to have longer T2 relaxation periods than other regions.（CSF > gray matter > white matter).

### T2* contrast
Quantitatively, the relationship between T2 and T2* is given by 1/T2* = (1/T2 ) + (1/T2ʹ), where T2 ʹ reflects the dephasing effect caused by field inhomogeneity. Like T2 contrast, T2* contrast is provided by pulse sequences with long TR and intermediate TE values. An additional requirement is that the pulse sequence must use magnetic field gradients (and GRE pulse sequences) to generate the signal echo.

### Chemical contrast
An important technique used to measure these substances is called chemical shift imaging. The chemical shift reflects the difference in proton resonance frequencies in different molecules.

### MR angiography

For a typical contrastenhanced MRA, a small quantity (or bolus) of a gadolinium-based contrast agent is injected into the patient’s bloodstream. The gadolinium itself is not visible on MR images, but it radically shortens the T 1 recovery period for nearby blood, allowing the use of specialized pulse sequences with extremely short TRs (3 to 7 ms) and TEs (1 to 3 ms).

There are two primary techniques for endogenous, contrast MRA. The most common is **time-of-flight (TOF) MRA**. By repeatedly and frequently applying excitation pulses (SE) or gradient pulses (GRE) to a single imaging plane, the signal within that plane can be suppressed (spin satuation). Thus, tissues whose spins remain within the plane, such as gray or white matter, will produce little MR signal. Blood vessels, however, are constantly replenished with new spins from outside the plane, which contribute normal levels of MR signal. The TR and slice thickness of a TOF image must be chosen based on the expected flow.

The imaging plane is presaturated by the electromagnetic excitation pulse and gradient saturation pulses. After a brief waiting period during which fresh blood can enter the plane, the MR signals are acquired by a GRE acquisition technique, so that only the signal from this new blood will be present.

A second technique is **velocity-encoded phase RF contrast (VENC-PC) MRA**, which uses gradient fields to produce a difference in precession phase between the vasculature and the surrounding tissue. Typical VENC-PC protocols involve the acquisition of two sets of images: one with a strong gradient and the other with either no gradient or a gradient in the opposite direction. The difference between these images indicates the magnitude of the phase difference at each voxel, so the brightness at each voxel is proportional to flow.

### Diffusion-weighted contrast

Diffusion weighting is the application of controlled gradient magnetic fields to quantify the amplitude and direction of diffusion. The attenuation effect (A) due to diffusion weighting (assuming a constant amplitude for the diffusion weighting gradient) is given by the exponential
$$A=e^{-bD}=e^{-D∫_0^T [ γ G(t)t ]^2 dt}$$
where D is the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) (i.e., the measured value of the diffusion coefficient), G is the strength of the diffusion-weighting gradient, and T is the duration of the diffusion-weighting gradient.

To determine the coefficients of diffusion along different directions (i.e., axes of a diffusion tensor), we need to apply controlled gradients in a pulse sequence. These gradients must be balanced in time to preserve the MR signal.

* spin-echo sequences: presenting the gradients before and after the refocusing pulse.
* gradient-echo sequences: successive positive and negative gradients.

### Perfusion-weighted contrast

The irrigation of tissues via blood delivery is known as perfusion, and the family of imaging procedures that measure this process is known as perfusion MRI. In the human brain, gray-matter perfusion is approximately 60 mL/100 g/min; white-matter perfusion is lower, about 20 mL/100 g/min. Perfusion MRI is used most frequently to generate images of blood flow in capillaries and other small vessels.
